(Fixed)*Zooming in/out and then have ghost, doesn't scale correctly.
(Fixed)*Zooming in/out causes bullets to move to the spot on field and not the correct scaled spot.
(Fixed)*Enemy (and maybe tower) range for detecting enemies is not corrilated with the scale.
*Can't zoom in/out or drag on all tiles on map.
*Zooming in/out on map does not keep centered how I would expect/want.
*Can move gems slightly out of invintory box depending on where they are grabbed.
*Gems don't stack in the invintory box/bag. Want them to stack slightly and newest one is always on top.
